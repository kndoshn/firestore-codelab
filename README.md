# Friendly Eats Extended Codelab

This is the source code that accompanies the
[Firestore Extended iOS Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-firestore-workshop-swift).

The codelab will walk you through developing a more fully-featured restaurant
recommendation app powered by Cloud Firestore on iOS.

If you don't want to do the codelab and would rather view the completed sample
code, see the `codelab-complete` branch.
